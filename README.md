## Introduction

It takes way too long to download all of the great images in InterfaceLIFT's wallpaper collection by hand, and I'm too much of a cheap bastard to pay them for the privilege of using their bulk download service. So here is the leechers way of grabbing all of their wallpapers quickly, easily, and for free.

## Install

Install this package globally via NPM by running the following command:

```shell
npm install -g interfacelift-downloader
```

You now have access to the `interfacelift-downloader` command.

## Usage

`interfacelift-downloader [resolution] [path]`

The `interfacelift-downloader` command accepts two arguments:

* The **resolution** option needs to be the image resolution that you want to search for (e.g. 1920x1080).
* The **path** is the path to save the downloaded files to. If specified this must be a path to a folder based on your current working directory (e.g. downloads, or ../wallpaper/1080) or the full path. (e.g. ~/downloads, or /Users/steven/downloads) If this option is omitted then files will be saved to your current working directory.

### To save files to your current folder

Navigate to the path that you want to save the files in and execute the `interfacelift-downloader` command with the resolution that you want to search for as an argument. Here is an example:

```shell
interfacelift-downloader 1920x1080
```
This will tell the script to search for all images with a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels and save them to your current working directory. It will not download or overwrite any existing files.

### To save files to a specific folder

Same as above but specify the path to the save directory from your current working directory as the third argument. For example:

```shell
interfacelift-downloader 1920x1080 downloads/1920x1080
```

This will tell the script to search for all images with a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels and save them to the downloads/1920x1080 directory. It will not download or overwrite any existing files.

You can also specify a full path.

```shell
interfacelift-downloader 1920x1080 ~/downloads/1920x1080
```

```shell
interfacelift-downloader 1920x1080 /Users/steven/downloads/1920x1080
```
